# Show Me The Money

The app consists of a backend built with Express.js and a frontend built with React and Vite.

This solution can be run in two ways:  
1. **Using Docker** (Recommended)  
2. **Running everything independently**  

## ðŸš€ Running with Docker  
1. **Clone the repository**  
2. **Start all services using Docker Compose**  
   > docker-compose up --build
   
3. **Open the application** in your browser:  
   ðŸ‘‰ [http://localhost:3001/](http://localhost:3001/)

---

## ðŸ›  Running Independently  
Follow these steps if you prefer to run each service manually:

1. **Clone the repository**  

2. **Install dependencies**  
   > yarn install


3. **Start the Xero mock API**  
   > docker run -p 3000:3000 jaypeng2015/show-me-the-money

4. **Start the backend server**  
   > yarn dev:server

5. **Start the frontend app**  
   > yarn dev

6. **Run tests**
   > yarn test

Now, open [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/) in your browser to use the app.

## Tech Stack

1. **Frontend**: React, Vite, TypeScript, Styled Components
2. **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, TypeScript
3. **Containerization**: Docker, Docker Compose

## Notes
The project structure could be further refined. Due to time constraints and the need to set up a local development environment quickly, some configurations were done on the fly. Additionally, error handling and logging could be improved to enhance maintainability and debugging. I also took this opportunity to brush up on Express.js, as I hadnâ€™t worked with it recently. Despite these limitations, I enjoyed working on this challenge!
